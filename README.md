Firestore Rules:

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /posts/{postId} {
      allow read: if true;  // Anyone can read posts
      allow write: if request.auth != null;  // Only authenticated users can write
    }
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;  // Authenticated users can read other documents
      allow write: if false;  // Disallow writes to all other collections
    }
  }
}

Firebase Storage Rules:

service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;  // Authenticated users can read and write
    }
  }
}

5. Run the App

Once Firebase is set up, run the app on your emulator or device:
